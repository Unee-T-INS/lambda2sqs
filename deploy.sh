# This is in case there is no aws cli profile
# in that case, the aws profile needs to be created from scratch.
# This happens when:

#	  We rely on the Travis CI settings that have been called when the
#	  .travis.yml script is called.
#	- The user has not configured his machine properly.

#Step 2: Run Makefile.
